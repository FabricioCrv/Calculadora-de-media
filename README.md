# Calculadora-de-media

This project was part of an assignment at Universidade de Fortaleza (also known as Unifor), you define the number of students and the grades of the 2 tests they took and calculate their overall final score, it will point out the highest score and lowest score of each test, followed by ordering the final scores from lowest to highest.

If their final score is less than 5 they have to retake the test, which will be calculated along with their previous final score, which will determine if the student will pass or not. The program was written in Javascript using HTML's <script> space.
